This started out as a pet project to build on some election boundary data.
It came to life at the DMA.Hack 2014 event, where a first iteration of the
address-to-postal-code translation was put together.

If you run the `postal` script, you will see it converts a given street
address into a Singapore postal code, and currently makes just a form post
to the SingPost website.

It is still rudimentary.
